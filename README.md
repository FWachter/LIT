# LIT

Lit stands for Light Interactive Technology. This is a project that is being developed under Drexel TPED (Theme Park Engineering and Design) which is a student group at Drexel University located in the Philadelphia, USA. 

This repository contains the MATLAB simulations that were developed in order to create the animation in SolidWorks, which is linked below, and will contain the Arduino and Raspi code that will be put onto the final system.

Links to the MATLAB and SolidWorks simulations can be seen below:
